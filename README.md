# Tumour detection software

This project was completed as a final year research project for a bachelor's degree. The goal was to train deep learning models to detect tumors in breast MRIs.

There are multiple README files in the subfolders, as all code corresponds to different parts of the project.

If you want to try out the web application, sample images in .dcm and .png formats can be found in the folder 'Samples'.
