# Tumour detection software

This project was completed as a final-year research project for a bachelor's degree. The goal was to train deep learning models to detect tumours in breast MRIs.

There are multiple README files in the subfolders, as all code corresponds to different parts of the project.

If you want to try out the web application, sample images in .dcm and .png formats can be found in the folder 'Samples'. However, both Resnet and Densenet PyTorch models are too big to be uploaded on GitHub, therefore, mobilenet was simply copied and renamed so that the application could work as intended
