# Pre-processing Python script
The dataset went through a few pre-processing steps, as it had way too many files for the computer power available for this project.

The pre-processing.py, classifies using the annotation, the image as positive or negative and converts the .dcm to .png

reduce_dataset.py is used to reduce the number of images

spilt_dataset.py is to split the dataset into training, validation and test directories. 

## Files
The files cannot be run without the images and other annotations from the dataset. The full original dataset can be found at https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/duke-breast-cancer-mri/, with all the CSV files required as they are too big to be uploaded on GitHub.
